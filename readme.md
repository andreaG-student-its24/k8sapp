k8sapp Deployment Guide
This guide explains how to build the Docker image, deploy the application to Kubernetes, expose it via a Service, and access it locally using port forwarding.

1. Build the Docker Image
First, build the Docker image for your application:

docker build -t k8sapp:v1 .
2. Kubernetes Deployment
Dry Run (Check Manifest)
Validate your deployment manifest before applying:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=client
Apply Deployment
Create the deployment in your cluster:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
3. Create a Service
Assuming you have a service.yaml manifest, validate and apply it:

Dry Run
kubectl apply -f service.yaml --dry-run=client
Apply Service
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
4. Port Forwarding
To access your application locally (assuming the container exposes port 5000):

kubectl port-forward deployment/k8sapp 5000:5000
Now you can access the app at http://localhost:5000/api/hello.

Summary of Steps
1. Build the Docker image: Prepares your app for deployment.
2. Dry run manifests: Validates your YAML files before making changes.
3. Apply deployment and service: Creates resources in Kubernetes.
4. Port forwarding: Lets you access the app from your local machine.
